rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[1m])
The metric node_network_receive_bytes_total is a metric of type counter. 
A counter metric is a cumulative number that is always going up. For this example,
 the number of bytes received is always increasing. The rate function calculates 
 the rate of increase of this metric per second. Lastly the [1m] is the range 
 selector for the query, determining the window in which to average the values
  across (ie. take all the values over the last minute for this per-second value).
   This helps us specify how far back values should be fetched for each resulting
    data point.
