Understanding Prometheus architecture

In Prometheus, it is important to first understand the concept of series.

Series is a metric name with given labels. 
each unique combination of a metric name and its label values forms a distinct series in Prometheus

As an example
node_cpu_total_seconds{"instance=inst1"} is a series
Similarly,
node_cpu_total_seconds{"instance=inst1", "mode=irq"} is another series 
and 
node_cpu_total_seconds{"instance=inst1","mode=sys"} is another series

Now data points from the same series within a specific time range 
are chunked together.
This data is compressed and encoded and is optimized for high 
storage of data in a compact format.
